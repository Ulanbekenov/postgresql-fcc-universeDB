# Build a Celestial Bodies Database

In this project, I built a comprehensive database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL. The objective was to manage data related to various celestial entities, such as stars, planets, moons, and other astronomical phenomena. The database was designed to facilitate efficient querying and storage of information while ensuring data integrity and relationships between different celestial bodies.

## Features:
- Created a structured database schema to categorize celestial bodies.
- Developed SQL queries to insert, update, and retrieve data efficiently.
- Implemented data validation to maintain the integrity of the information.
- Generated reports to analyze and present data about the celestial bodies.

## Technologies Used:
- PostgreSQL for the database management system.
- Gitpod for the development environment.

This project serves as a valuable exercise in database management and SQL, reinforcing my understanding of relational databases.
